Apache Parquet Introduction

Apache Parquet is a columnar file format that provides optimizations to speed up queries and is a far more efficient file format than CSV or JSON, supported by many data processing systems.

It is compatible with most of the data processing frameworks in the Hadoop echo systems. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk.

Spark SQL provides support for both reading and writing Parquet files that automatically capture the schema of the original data, It also reduces data storage by 75% on average. Below are some advantages of storing data in a parquet format. Spark by default supports Parquet in its library hence we donâ€™t need to add any dependency libraries.

Apache Parquet Advantages:

Below are some of the advantages of using Apache Parquet. combining these benefits with Spark improves performance and gives the ability to work with structure files.

   Reduces IO operations.

   Fetches specific columns that you need to access.

   It consumes less space.

   Support type-specific encoding.
